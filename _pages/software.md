## Parabible

<div class="lead lead-about">If you see nothing else of what I am working on, you should see <https://parabible.com/>.

Parabible is a tool that has transformed the way I do Old Testament studies by faciliating pretty sophisticated searches by letting users build searches based on morphological data quickly and easily (to understand a bit more of that, take a look at the gifs posted on <https://twitter.com/parabible_com>)

## FixPDFs

FixPDFs is a tool I made to resolve challenges faced when working with scanned documents. In PhD work, I often found myself scanning book chapters or receiving scans of journal articles that were double page spread, pages were skew, and sometimes they were color scans. This meant that reading involved contending with inconsistent margins and border noise, often with no OCR. FixPDFs takes PDFs with those sorts of problems and clean them up, making them easier to read and work with. You can find it at <https://fixpdfs.com/>.

It uses cloudflare workers, supabase, and stripe. It also uses a sprinkling of ML magic. It doesn't earn me a lot of side-income yet. But, as is always the case with side projects, it's been a good learning experience and provides value to me and a few others.

Here are a few ways you can get an idea of my coding more generally...
